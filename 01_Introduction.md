# Become a Computer Expert

Hi Chris. I want to guide you a bit into the computer world. So I will help you to find topics, that you need to understand and learn when you want to use this as a carrier path later. The topics will be very wide and not only be related to learning to programm.  making a challange

I will not be able to explain everything to you. This is more a guide for you, on what topics you should look. And I will try to share resources to find good answers.  

Your job will be to read/watch the content. Or you need to research it for yourself. This document is here for you to store your findings and be a reference for later use.

## Markdown

The very first thing I ask you to do, is look into markdown language. This very file is written in md. It is a language to document things and write texts. It has several advantages over just using Word or any other text program.

Here is a link to a good [source](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/).

You can quickly format things, like writing **bold**, *italics*. You see me using many lists in this document. You can create tables like

Topic | Sources | finished at
---- | ---- | ---
learn computer stuff | all I can find | never
markdown | see above | I have to look at the cheat sheet from time to time

You can also document code, for example in line `git push`. Or you can use full code blocks:

```javascript
let message = 'Hello Christian. Nice to meet you!'
console.log(message)
```

You can copy the code to this [playground](https://playcode.io/empty_javascript) and see what happens.
